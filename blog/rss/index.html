Still, many are left asking themselves “What exactly is an NFT?”  Whether you’re a potential collector, savvy business owner, or just a curious mind, we’ve taken all the guesswork out of that question. Here are NFTs, explained.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-an-nft">So, What is an NFT?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://bitpay.com/blog/content/images/2022/01/how-to-make-sell-nfts.png" class="kg-image" alt="What is an NFT?

An NFT is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain that can represent tangible and intangible items. The most popular NFTs to date have been in the form of digital items like art, but NFTs can be used to show ownership of a physical item like a pair of exclusive sneakers or even a piece of real estate.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class="callout-box"><strong>Quick breakdown:</strong> Fungible means that something is interchangeable with another item; it is exactly the same. A gold coin can be swapped out for an exact equal. Gold is fungible. Non-fungible means that something can’t be exchanged for an identical item. It is the only one in existence. Diamonds are non-fungible. A single diamond has unique characteristics that make it unlike any other. The token in non-fungible token refers to a digital certificate that shows ownership.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><h2 id="how-do-nfts-work">How Do NFTs Work?</h2><p>NFTs are powered by smart contracts, most commonly on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are created by the process of “minting”. This is when a digital file is transformed into a digital asset. The asset is given a unique fingerprint (hash), token name, and token symbol. Once minted, this asset can then be stored on the blockchain, traded, or sold. Like other cryptocurrency transactions, records of ownership and transfers of digital assets will be stored on the blockchain for all to see.</p><hr><h3 id="want-to-accept-crypto-for-nfts-bitpay-makes-it-easy-">Want to accept crypto for NFTs?

Without art houses or middlemen, artists retain more money from each piece sold. Additionally, creators can program royalties into digital artwork so they receive income each time the work is resold to a new owner.<br></p><h3 id="how-collectors-can-benefit-from-nfts">How Collectors Can Benefit from NFTs</h3><p>NFT collectors can buy their digital assets knowing that they own a truly unique asset. Unlike baseball cards or works of art that have been replicated many times over, NFTs are verifiably genuine. Collectors also have the opportunity to generate wealth from their collections. NFTs can function as any other speculative item like real estate or Bitcoin, gaining value as demand grows.<br><br></p><h3 id="how-businesses-can-benefit-from-nfts">How Businesses Can Benefit from NFTs</h3><p>Savvy businesses have already started engaging with the NFT community. Businesses can use NFTs to tie ownership to physical items, like Nike’s Crypto Kicks blockchain-based shoe authentication system. NFTs can also be used for promotional and marketing purposes. Business use-cases for NFTs will continue to evolve as brands showcase their creativity and ingenuity.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/how-brands-use-nfts/" class="related-article">Related article: How Brands Can Use NFTs for Marketing and Much More</a><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><h2 id="popular-nfts-created-by-brands">Popular NFTs Created by Brands</h2><p>Many forward-thinking brands have created their own NFTs. <br></p><h3 id="coca-cola-s-friendship-lootbox">Coca-Cola’s Friendship Lootbox</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://bitpay.com/blog/content/images/2022/01/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="What is an NFT?

In this case, we’ll review how to create an NFT in its most popular form, digital art.<br></p><h3 id="step-1-choose-your-digital-asset">Step 1: Choose Your Digital Asset</h3><p>NFTs can take the form of art, videos, music, soundscapes, collectibles, memes, animated GIFs, and so much more. Choose something you want to represent your brand and resonate with your audience. One important note is that you must own the intellectual property rights to your item. Minting an NFT with property you don’t own can land you in trouble. <br></p><h3 id="step-2-decide-which-blockchain-you-want-to-use">Step 2: Decide Which Blockchain You Want to Use</h3><p>Before you can create your NFT (also known as “minting”), you will choose which blockchain the NFT will live on. The most popular choice for NFT creators is Ethereum. Whichever blockchain you choose will also be how your customers typically purchase the NFT. BitPay can help convert Ethereum purchases into cash for your business, eliminating all risk and complexity in accepting cryptocurrency. Read more about our NFT payment solution.<br></p><h3 id="step-3-create-a-wallet-to-store-your-nfts">Step 3: Create a wallet to store your NFTs</h3><p>Like cryptocurrency, NFTs are digital assets that live on the blockchain. You need to store digital assets in a <a href="https://bitpay.com/wallet/">crypto wallet</a>. Popular wallets to store your NFTs include Metamask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase.</p><p></p><h3 id="step-4-mint-your-nft">Step 4: Mint Your NFT</h3><p>Minting is the process of transforming your file into a digital asset that lives on the blockchain. You generally have two choices on how to create an NFT.</p><ul><li><strong>Leverage a marketplace (less technical)</strong> - Specialized NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible are gaining popularity. Many marketplaces operate as a one stop shop where you can mint (the act of digitizing your asset) and list your NFT for sale. A community of NFT supporters then have the option to buy and trade within that marketplace.</li><li><strong>Mint the NFT yourself (more technical)</strong> - While minting your own NFT is doable, it is not suggested for beginners.</li></ul><p></p><h3 id="step-5-release-and-distribute-your-nft">Step 5: Release and Distribute Your NFT</h3><p>What good does an NFT provide if no one knows about it? A few popular distribution strategies you can use are:</p><ul><li><strong>Sell for a flat rate </strong>- This can be an easy way to make your NFTs accessible to your usual customer base (see Pringles <em>CryptoCrisp</em> rollout)</li><li><strong>Auction off to highest bidders</strong> - Many brands choose to donate proceeds to a non-profit organization or cause (see Coca-Cola’s <em>Friendship Lootbox</em>)</li><li><strong>Give away for free on a limited basis - </strong>If you want to drum up quick attention, this can be a good way to promote your brand’s NFTs<strong> </strong> (see <em>McLaren Racing Collective</em>).<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Whichever distribution method you choose, BitPay can support your NFT release by facilitating crypto payments for your NFT.</p><hr><h3 id="start-releasing-nfts-and-accept-crypto-bitpay-makes-it-easy-">Start releasing NFTs and accept crypto.
