<p>When Newegg wanted to expand the cryptocurrency payment option globally to 72 countries, BitPay was naturally the best fit to scale their acceptance option.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newegg reports that since the company started accepting cryptocurrency outside North America, the percentage of payments made with cryptocurrency on a global scale has been nearly five times higher than it has been in the United States and Canada during that same timeframe.</p>

<h3>The Challenge:</h3>
<br>
The motivation for many to invest in precious metals like silver coins and gold bars is to hedge against market volatility or worse, a potential failure with traditional currencies. Investors often have that same motivation to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. As a result, companies selling gold and other precious metals online often want to accept cryptocurrency to attract new buyer, and capture sales from this unique audience.  Furthermore, low-margin industries like precious metal businesses can benefit from BitPay’s flat 1% processing fee (credit cards typically charge a 2-3% processing fee) in addition to escaping fraud and chargebacks.

There are many potential customers waiting for their favorite retailers to accept Bitcoin. However, many smaller tech companies, surprisingly, aren't aware of the benefits of working with BitPay to accept crypto while large brands like Microsoft, NewEgg, Namecheap, and the Dallas Mavericks (to name a few) are eagerly signing up when they hear that they can attract new customers, who also typically spend more on purchases when using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://bitpay.com/resources/content/images/2019/10/Sonny_Singh_img-copy.png" class="kg-image" alt="Forbes: BitPay Says Big Brands "Get" Bitcoin"><figcaption>Sonny Singh, Chief Commercial Officer, BitPay</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>To hear the full story, read about it in Forbes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div align="center"><div class="button"><a style="color:white" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinoconnell/2019/08/28/cool-hip-tech-brands-dont-get-bitcoin-but-global-brands-do/">Read the article</a></div></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nexusguard Systems Security Company Chooses Bitcoin Payments]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3>The Opportunity:</h3>
